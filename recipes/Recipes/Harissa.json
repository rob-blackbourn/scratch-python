  "recipeIngredient": [
    "12 to 15 dried red chili peppers (approx. 1 1/2 oz. or 100 g)",
    "3 or 4 cloves garlic",
    "1 teaspoon salt, or to taste",
    "1 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds (optional)",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground caraway seeds (optional)",
    "2 to 3 teaspoons lemon juice",

  "recipeInstructions": [
    "Remove the seeds from the dried chili peppers and place them in a bowl. Cover them with very hot water and leave to soften for 30 minutes to an hour.",
    "Drain the chili peppers, and gently squeeze out excess water with a paper towel. Using a mortar and pestle (or a blender or mini food processor) grind the chili peppers, garlic, salt and spices to a paste. Add the lemon juice and just enough olive oil to moisten the harissa, or add additional olive oil to thin it.",
    "Store unused harissa in an airtight container in the fridge. For long storage, lightly top the harissa with a little oil before covering."
