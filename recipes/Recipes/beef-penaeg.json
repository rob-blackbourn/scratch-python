    "2. Blanch the meat from a cold water start (to soften it\u2019s flavour) and rinse. Bring the coconut milk to the boil, add the beef, then turn down the heat and braise gently until tender (about 2 hours). Allow to cool in the liquid, then remove and slice.",

Add the sliced beef, simmer briefly to heat through, and finish with the remaining ingredients."
