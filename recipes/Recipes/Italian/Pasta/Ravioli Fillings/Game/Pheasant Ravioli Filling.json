  "recipeYield": "6 portions",
  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 pheasant legs (deboned),",
    "a sprig of rosemary,",
    "1 banana shallot,",
    "40 g pancetta (chopped),",
    "4 tbsp double cream,",
    "1 egg,",
    "2 tbsp grated Parmesan."
  ],
  "recipeInstructions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7.",
    "2. Cut off the pheasant's legs, debone the thighs, reserving the bones and the lower leg for stock. Chop into two pieces.",
    "3. Season the skin.",
    "4. Heat an ovenproof saut\u00e9 pan until it smokes, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil and put in the legs, skin-side down. Cook until the skin turns golden.",
    "5. Add the chopped pancetta and a finely chopped shallot.",
    "6. Turn over the legs, cook for a couple more minutes, then add a glass of dry white wine and cook until the alcohol evaporates.",
    "7. Transfer to the oven until the meat is cooked through, then remove and allow to cool a little.",
    "8. While the meat is still warm, tip the lot into a food processor and whizz to a rough paste.",
    "9. Spoon a little of the mixture at a time on to a board, and run over it with a spatula or table knife, to feel whether there is any shot in it - if so, remove it.",
    "10. Put the mixture into a bowl, add two tablespoons of grated Parmesan and one egg, and season.",
    "11.  Stir in four tablespoons of double cream, then put into the fridge.",
    "12. Once it's cold, roll small amounts of the mixture into little balls (two legs should give you enough for 32 balls), and place on a tray or plate, ready for filling your ravioli. These balls can also be frozen, for later use."
