    "60 g plain flour,",

  "recipeInstructions": [
    "1. Put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Add one-third of the milk, the eggs, a pinch of salt and a twist of pepper. Whisk lightly to make a smooth batter, then pour in the rest of the milk and mix thoroughly. Pass the batter through a chinois or fine sieve. Cover with cling film and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes. ",
    "2. Just before cooking the cr\u00eapes, stir the herbs into the batter. Lightly grease a 26-30cm frying pan with a touch of clarified butter and place over a high heat. Give the batter a stir then ladle in just enough to cover the base of the pan. Cook quickly for about 1 minute, then turn over with a palette knife and cook for barely a minute more. Repeat until you have used all the batter. Stack the cr\u00eapes on a plate, layering a piece of greaseproof paper between each to prevent them sticking together. "
