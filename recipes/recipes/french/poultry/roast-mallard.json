    "Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0C/450\u00b0F/Gas Mark 8.",
    "Season the mallard with salt and freshly ground pepper, running some lard or butter over the carcass to keep it moist.",
    "Tip: For heavier birds of 1kg, double the cooking time to 60 minutes.",
    "Place in a baking tray and roast for 10 mins. Reduce the temperature to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/Gas Mark 4 and cook for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to rest in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes. The meat should be slightly pink to serve, but if you prefer the meat less pink add 5-7 minutes onto the cooking time."
