    "1 lb (500g) beef steak sliced into very thin strips or diced into  3/4\" cubes,",
    "12 wooden skewers"
  ],
  "recipeInstructions": [
    "1. Soak the skewers for 20 minutes.",
    "2. Pour the marinade over and stir well to combine. Allow at least 1 hour for marinating, or longer (up to 24 hours).",
    "3. When ready to cook, thread meat onto the skewers. Tip: Fill up to 3/4 of the skewer; leaving the lower half empty so the person grilling has a \"handle\" to easily turn the satay.",
    "4. Cook on an outdoor grill, basting the first time you time it with a little of the leftover marinade from the bottom of the bowl. Turn the satay every 5 to 6 minutes until done to your liking (15 to 25 minutes)."
