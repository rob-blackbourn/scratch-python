  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 thumb-piece ginger (grated),",
    "4-5 cloves garlic,",
    "1 stalk lemongrass,",
    "1 red chili, sliced,",
    "1/4 cup chopped unsalted cashews (+ a few more for garnish)",
    "1 tsp ground coriander,",
    "1 tsp whole cumin seed,",
    "1/2 tsp white pepper,",
    "1 tsp turmeric,",
    "1/8 tsp cardamon,",
    "1 tsp tamarind, or substitute 1 1bsp lime juice",
    "1 tbsp brown sugar",
    "3/4 tsp shrimp paste,"
  ],
  "recipeInstructions": [
    "Place stock in a large pot over high heat. Add the meat, onion and bay leaves. If using fresh lemongrass, also add the upper leftover stalk pieces. Bring to a boil then reduce to low, until you get a nice simmer. Cover or partially-cover with a lid and simmer 40 to 80 minutes, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender or near-tender.",
    "Add all curry sauce ingredients, stirring with each addition. Also add the potatoes and whole star anise. Return to a boil, then continue simmering 30 more minutes or until potatoes are tender. Stir occasionally.",
    "Taste-test the curry, adding more fish sauce for increased flavor/saltiness, or more chili if you want it spicier. If too sour, add a little more sugar. If too salty or sweet for your taste, add a touch more tamarind or lime juice. If too spicy, add more coconut milk.",
    "Transfer to a serving bowl, or plate up on individual plates or bowls. Top with a few more cashews and fresh basil."
