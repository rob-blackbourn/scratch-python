    "1. Pull off the green leaves surrounding the cauliflower. Then cut the bottom off & break the cauliflower into large pieces. Rinse & then place in a bowl to be used later.",
    "2. Heat the olive oil in either a saucepan or pressure cooker. Cook the beef in the oil until all the sides are brown.",
    "3. Add enough water in the pot to cover the beef. At this point put everything into the pot except the cauliflower and cover with a lid. If using a saucepan simmer the beef for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you are using a pressure cooker, let the beef cook for 15 minutes (after the cooker begins to hiss).",
    "4. Dip the cauliflower into the sauce to cover all the sides. Once that is done leave it in the pot & recover with a lid. Simmer for another 15 minutes or until the cauliflower is done. If using a pressure cooker, cover and cook for additional 5-7 minutes (after the cooker begins to hiss)."
